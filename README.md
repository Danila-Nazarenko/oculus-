The Oculus project is a modern website built using responsive layout techniques based on CSS Grid and Flexbox. Its main goal is to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface across various devices and screen resolutions.

The project employs the following technologies and approaches:

Responsive layout with CSS Grid:
Used to construct the main structure of the page, allowing for the easy creation of complex grids with different content areas. Grid provides flexible element placement, automatic adaptation to screen sizes, and the ability to define regions for images, text, and other components.

Flexible layout with Flexbox:
Applied for aligning and distributing elements within individual blocks. Flexbox is ideal for horizontal and vertical menus, product cards, control panels, and other components where dynamic space redistribution is important.

Responsiveness:
Media queries are implemented in the project to adjust sizes, positioning, and display of elements depending on the screen width. This ensures comfortable interaction both on mobile devices and large monitors.

In summary, the Oculus project features a modern design with high responsiveness and usability achieved through a well-balanced combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox in its adaptive layout.<br><br><br><br><br>
